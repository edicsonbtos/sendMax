INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of python-telegram-bot to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested httpx==0.27.2
    python-telegram-bot 20.8 depends on httpx~=0.26.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    httpx

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
